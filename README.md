# MAAS 15 Minute Demo

## Introduction to the Demo Document

There are three parts to the demo.

- [Part 1: Setting up demo resources](#part-1-setting-up-demo-resources)
- [Part 2: Deploying models as a service](#part-2-deploying-models-as-a-service)
- [Part 3: Introduction to the Azure AI Model Inference SDK](#part-3-introduction-to-the-azure-ai-model-inference-sdk)

## Demo Goal

The goal is to showcase the variety of models accessible through Azure AI Foundry, emphasize their deployment simplicity, and the developer's flexibility to select different models according to requirements without code changes using the Azure AI Model Inference SDKs.

## Terms Used

### Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry is a platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage AI solutions. It provides a range of pre-trained models that can be deployed as a service, as well as tools for training custom models. Azure AI Foundry is accessible either via a UI-based experience through a [web portal](https://ai.azure.com) or a unified SDK that enables a code-first approach.

### Azure AI Foundry Models as a Service

Azure AI Foundry Models as a Service (MaaS) are pre-trained models that can be deployed as a service. They are accessible via REST APIs and SDKs and can be used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, text completion, and text classification.

### Serverless Models

Serverless models are deployed on-demand and are cost-effective. They are ideal for low to moderate usage scenarios. The models are deployed as a service and can be accessed via REST APIs and SDKs. This demo uses serverless models.

### Managed Compute

Managed compute models are deployed on dedicated resources and are ideal for high-usage scenarios. They are more expensive than serverless models but offer better performance and scalability.

### AI Foundry Hubs and Projects

Azure AI Foundry Hubs are the units of organization for models. They are deployed by region, and you can have multiple hubs in a region. The models are deployed by project, and projects are deployed by hub.

### Phi3

The [Phi-3 model](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/discover-the-new-multi-lingual-high-quality-phi-3-5-slms/ba-p/4225280) collection is the Microsoft's family of Small Language Models (SLMs). They are designed to be highly capable and cost-effective, outperforming models of similar and larger sizes across various benchmarks in language, reasoning, coding, and math.

### Mistral

Mistral is a large language model available from [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/). It is a powerful model that can be used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, text completion, and text classification and is available in Azure AI Foundry.

## Considerations

- Reproducible. Models selected for the demo should be generally available for your subscription.
- Model availability
  - To keep simple, two models Mistral and Phi 3
    - Requires one Hub in East US 2, to accomodate model's availability
- Minimizing costs. The models are pay-as-you-go and cost fractions of cents to use. If you decide to use your Visual Studio linked account then you will need to connect your Credit Card but there are considerably more models available that you’ll be able to successfully deploy and will consume Azure credits. Note, you can’t remove your credit card once enabled.
- While setting up AI Foundry model resources is quick, it generally takes a few minutes to complete. Therefore, it's advisable to set up the demo resources in advance and then explain their setup process during the demonstration.

## What subscription to use

You should be able to use your Microsoft corporate subscription, and your Microsoft linked personal Visual Studio subscription, and you will find different combinations of models available depending on the subscription you use. For this demo, it’s assumed you’ll be using your Microsoft Corporate subscription.
